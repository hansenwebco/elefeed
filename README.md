# Elefeed

Elefeed is an experimental front end for testing new ways to view feeds for Mastodon servers.

## Overview

The main effort around Elefeed is letting users view their main feeds either as a full feed of hashtags and users they follow, but with the ability to split that into different feeds based on what the user wants to focus on. 

This project serves as a Proof of Concept (POC) to better understand these interactions and look for ways to improve the readability of Mastodon servers.

## Features

- **Custom Feeds:** Split and organize the main feed into different feeds based on topics, hashtags, or users you want to focus on.
- **Improved Readability:** Focused on providing a better reading and interaction experience compared to default server interfaces.

## Development

Currently running as a simple static web application. To run the project locally, serve the directory (e.g., using `npx serve -p 8080`).

```bash
npx serve -p 8080
```
